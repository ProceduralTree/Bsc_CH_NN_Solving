#+title: Tasks

* TODO Tests [1/2]
- [X] try different:
  - [X] epsilon
  - [X] grid sizes
  - [X] time steps
- [ ] More grid variants (32x32, 64,64, 512x512 )
** TODO Rework Newton solver to analytical solution
missing \xi and \psi in claculations
rework
[[file:~/Projects/Bsc_CH_NN_Solving/multi_solver_relaxed.py::for iter in range(maxiter):]]

* TODO Enable adaptive SMOOTH operation
** Look for non-adaptive differences

* TODO Data gen for training [1/3]
- [X] initial test date phase field, and potential
- [ ] elliptical PDE data
- [-] more varied training data / larger datasets [2/4]
  - [ ] different seeds
  - [X] sphere phase field
  - [X] squares phase field
  - [ ] random phase fields
Tested multiple input. Output was useless as most iterations had unusable epsilon and did not calculate anything
* TODO write elliptical PDE solver [3/4]
- [X] outline of implementation
- [X] check newton derivative
- [X] use own newton solver for numba
- [ ] test

* TODO finish relaxed adaptations

* TODO check v_cycle implementation

* TODO test errors
* TODO Thesis [0/1]
- [ ] correct wrong relaxation (forgot \(\phi^\alpha\) term)
