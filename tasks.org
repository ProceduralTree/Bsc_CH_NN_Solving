#+title: Tasks

* TODO Tests [1/2]
- [X] try different:
  - [X] epsilon
  - [X] gridsizes
  - [X] timesteps
- [ ] More grid variants 832x32 , 64,64 , 512x512)
* TODO Enable adaptive SMOOTH operation
** Look for non adaptive differences

* TODO Data gen for training [1/3]
- [X] initial test date phasefield , and  potential
- [ ] elyptical PDE data
- [-] more varied training data / larger datasets [2/4]
  - [ ] different seeds
  - [X] sphere phasefield
  - [X] squares phasefield
  - [ ] random phasefields
* TODO write elyptical PDE solver [2/4]
- [X] outline of implementation
- [ ] check newton derivative
- [X] use own newton solver for numba
- [ ] test

* TODO finish relaxed adaptations

* TODO check v_cycle implementation

* TODO test errors
