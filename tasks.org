#+title: Tasks

* TODO Tests [0/1]
- [-] try different:
  - [ ] epsilon
  - [ ] gridsizes
  - [ ] timesteps
* TODO Enable adaptive SMOOTH operation
** Look for non adaptive differences

* TODO Data gen for training [1/3]
- [X] initial test date phasefield , and  potential
- [ ] elyptical PDE data
- [-] more varied training data / larger datasets [1/4]
  - [ ] different seeds
  - [ ] sphere phasefield
  - [X] squares phasefield
  - [ ] random phasefields
* TODO write elyptical PDE solver [2/4]
- [X] outline of implementation
- [ ] check newton derivative
- [X] use own newton solver for numba
- [ ] test

* TODO finish relaxed adaptations

* TODO check v_cycle implementation

* TODO test errors
